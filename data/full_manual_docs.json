The negotiation model presented in the CCHN Field Manual is intended to assist humanitarian professionals and their team to plan and review negotiation processes in a systematic and critical manner. By sharing their reflections on current engagements, frontline humanitarian negotiators will be able to evaluate and compare their options, develop new skills, and learn from each other\u2019s experience in addressing the recurring challenges and dilemmas of humanitarian negotiation. In the second version of the CCHN Field Manual, the readers will notice the increasing involvement of members of the community of practice of the CCHN in both the design and articulation of the methods and tools of the CCHN. While the first version drew extensively from the confidential interviews conducted by the CCHN in the early years of its mission, the new version is being additionally shaped by the growing interest of CCHN community members in contributing to the reflection on current practices and providing support to their colleagues in the field, ensuring the relevance and accessibility of the material to many types of users from frontline humanitarian operators to mandators working with local NGOs or international agencies. Hence the CCHWN Field Manual is connected to a series of practitioners\u2019 and facilitators",

Ultimately, the success of negotiation relies largely on the personal skills and sensitivity of each negotiator underpinning his or her ability to build the necessary trust with the counterparts in complex and challenging environments. The security and safety of humanitarian operations depend on their individual aptitude to adapt their objectives to the operational and political situation while responding to the demands and expectations of the affected populations and communities.",

Gale Halpern has provided much valued support and guidance in the editing of the first and second version of this Manual. The CCHN also benefited from the generous support of its donors, notably, the Swiss Department of Foreign Affairs, the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, and the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of Luxembourg.

For many, negotiation with parties to armed conflict has been, and is still, often per- ceived as part of political inter- plays among states and other powerful actors taking place outside the humanitarian space and away from the recognized humanitarian principles.

In 2006, under the auspices of OCHA, Gerard McHugh and Manuel Bessler produced a Manual for Practitioners on Humanitarian Negotiation with Armed Groups to develop policy guidance on addressing the dilemmas of principled negotiations, later revised in 2011 by Conflict Dynamics International (CDI) and the Swiss Department of Foreign Affairs. More recently, training programs have been developed by CDI, the Clingendael Institute, CERAH, and the Danish Red Cross/the Norwegian Refugee Council, among others, introducing core knowledge, tools, and skills on humanitarian negotiation and community mediation. The peer workshops of the CCHN are the latest iteration of this process, opening a safe space to exchange negotiation experience and reflect on challenges and dilemmas of humanitarian negotiation.",

It provides specific tools and reflections on every step of the process as well as a pattern of distribution of roles and responsibilities. It is important to mention that these steps and roles should not be taken in isolation. A manager or field operator can be engaged at various stages of concurrent negotiation processes in the same context where he/she may act alternatively as mandator, team member, or frontline negotiator, depending on the specific object of the negotiation and level of the counterpart. The Naivasha Grid encourages interactions between these steps and roles with the understand- ing that their actual distribution may evolve from one engage- ment to the next. A junior manager should therefore, for example, learn to lead a nego- tiation process on the frontline as well as play a support role as a team member and eventually mandate a negotiation process to a staff member under his/her supervision.

To draw an infor- mation advantage, the negotiator will need to diversify the sources of information and understandings of the situation to integrate new angles on central and lateral issues. The credibil- ity and predictability of the organization depend on the nego- tiator\u2019s ability to discern the required quality of information in the eyes of the counterpart (i.e., the tolerance for uncertainties and vagueness). With relatively solid information, the negotia- tor will be able to project self-assurance and the right level of connections with the environment. Gathering such information takes time and requires specific skills. One should note that the negotiator should not aim to become a substantive expert on the object of the negotiation. On the contrary, experts may destabilize the counterpart and prompt a withdrawal from the discussion. Humanitarian negotiators can always call on more expertise as the support structure of the negotiation process.",

To assert contested facts, a party often needs to agree, even implicitly, on convergent norms. Conversely, to assert a divergent norm, a party is more likely to agree on some facts of the situation. This somewhat counterintuitive interdepend- ence between facts and norms represents a significant asset for frontline negotiators on which they may build a relationship with the counterparts, even in a very divisive environment.",

At times, the com- mon appreciation of patience and reflection over tea may become a turning point of a re- lationship in a tense negotiation process. The point is to create a shared experience between the negotiators; to posit the negoti- ation as a co-owned process of discovery of various spaces of agreement. From there, frontline negotiators can move to build bridges and seek to establish a dialogue on some agreed facts or convergent norms as points of departure toward more substan- tive issues as the dialogue pro- gtesses and the trust builds up.",

A trusted negotiator will know how to maintain the space and protocol of a nego- tiation despite divergent views on the object of the negotia- tion. The longer the relation- ship between the negotiators, the more predictable the behaviors of the parties will be, and the more confidence the parties will have in the ability of the other side to adapt their respective positions.",

S/he needs to find a solution that will keep access to health care for all the IDPs. Surgeons are professionals well acquainted with difficult choices. They understand the military, being themselves officers in the national army. The MHI surgeon has extended expe- rience working in conflict zones. S/he understands that compromises need to be made at times. S/he is ready to discuss the situation with the local commander at any time. Medical doctors are serious and committed people. MHI surgeons are ready to look into all options in a dia- logue with the local commander. They have learned to be persistent and patient in this and other contexts. MHI as an organization MHI is a global medical organization with extended experience in conflict zones. Its mission is to assist all those in need based on IHL. MHI understands the precariousness of the security situation and is ready to adapt to the situation if it becomes unstable. MHI has been working in similar unstable circumstances in several countries to the satisfaction of the military authorities. Objectives of the negotiation: Keep the clinic accessible to all IDPs The health care situation in the IDP camp can become quickly tragic, with severe consequences on the lives of IDPs and stability of the camp. Full access to the clinic is imperative. MHI could consider opening an annex to the clinic within the compound so as to ensure the safety and security of some of its patients. MHI has been taking care of war wounded as well as civilians in all circumstances based on IHL. It does not preclude access to treatment based on political affiliation. This principle of neutrality is applicable in all countries.",

Technical ne- gotiations deal with engagement with local actors, explaining the expectations of the organ- ization, and focusing on the mobilization of support at the local level. The conversations tend to be factual in nature and call for the right data, evidence, and facts. The point of the conversation is to bring in the expertise of the organization in order to find an agreement on the modalities of the operation at the field level.",

In other words, the humanitarian negotiator should check if there is actually a violation of an interna- tional norm as the law is probably more conservative than the understanding of it by the humanitarian agencies. Hence, humanitarian negotiators should make sure that the norm exists and they should be able to explain it in simple and straightforward terms.",

Ignorance of the norm does not mean it is not a violation, but it does simplify the entry into a normative negotiation by explaining the existence of the international norm and seeing where the counterpart stands.

It offers a series of recommendations on handling normative divergence and simple tools to develop logical arguments to facilitate a discussion on the articulation of the opposite norm. It also aims to raise awareness that not all vi- olations of international norms are the result of normative diver- gences. The individual belief that the circumstances exempt the counterpart from complying with the law is not per se a diver- gence of the norm, but rather a problem of factual implemen- tation. Circumstances are a matter of facts calling for a factual negotiation, i.e., building evidence to convince the counterpart to change its policy. It is recommended to avoid treating such violation as a divergence of the norm in the absence of a com- munity of belief behind the behavior of the counterpart.",

The commitments may also encompass security guaran- tees, delivery schedules, modali- ties of visits, landing rights, etc. In exchange, organizations may agree to the terms of the coun- terparts regarding location of the office, scope of activities, visibil- ity, the selection of the targeted groups, methods of distribution, role of local authorities, among other things. The process may also involve further discussions on the orientation of humanitar- ian operations requested by the counterparts in terms of oper- ational priority throughout the duration; cooperation with other organizations, ministries, securi- ty, and police forces; etc.",

Prisons are in the hands of provincial authorities who have little to gain by exposing illegal practices in their region. The federal Minister of the Interior signs an agreement in the presence of high-level representatives of the Interna- tional Monitoring Network (IMN), an internationally recog- nized monitoring group, for complete access to all the pris- ons. Nevertheless, IMN monitors are unable to launch their program of visits due to technical difficulties at the field level. While the negotiation is deemed a success, the federal struc- ture of the government and the lack of control over the prison system from the central government have hindered the imple- mentation of the agreement. The federal government attrib- utes the difficulties to the local authorities and may procras- tinate on the implementation of the agreement, a possibility that should be weighed against the desire of the negotiators to reach an agreement at the transactional stage.",

Health for All (HA), an international medical NGO, has agreed with the Minister of Health of Country A to provide all the necessary vaccines to the clinics of the affected district over the next two weeks. To maintain cold chain (tem- perature-controlled refrigeration) requirements, HfA plans to use air delivery to carry its vaccines to the region. Howev- er, with the approaching rainy season, it is unlikely that the landing strip will be available to receive the air delivery with fixed-wing aircraft, raising the cost of air delivery due to the necessity of using helicopters. HfA does not have the budget to charter helicopters. Reaching an agreement on air delivery is therefore of minimal use if air logisticians and administra- tive planners of the NGO are not part of the negotiation to draw the parameters of a feasible arrangement.",

It organized a public event in a regional capital for the signing of a commitment by the armed group active in the district in exchange for which the families of demobilized children will receive educational material for their children. While the media coverage on the agreed commitments en- hanced the role and international profile of CACR in the fight against child recruitment and contributed to the public image of the armed group, many of the concerned children in the affected district\u2014in particular, girls\u2014were opposed to their demobilization, arguing that they felt safer with the armed group compared to living in destitute and chaotic internally displaced persons (IDP) camps where abuses are rampant. The demobilization program failed, and parents complained that there is no school for their children in the IDP camps.",

It considers the risks associated with a successful negotiation without a proper implementation plan due to the fact that negotiators on both sides may have created or maintained ambiguities in the terms of the agreement as a way of transferring the risk of misun- derstandings to the implementors in the field. Rather than forcing all the complicated points to be addressed in the negotiated agreement, it recommends the setting up of a process of handling misunderstandings and discrepancies of interpretation during the implementation phase of the agreement as these are unavoidable and should be ad- dressed resolutely, especially in complex and fragmented conflict environments.",

The agreement tends to put both sides on an equal footing. Hu- manitarian negotiators should be attentive to opportunities to integrate mitigation measures into their implementation tactics in case the counterparts decide to unreasonably complicate the implementation of the agreement. The ne- gotiator must always remember that these negotiations take place in a conflict environment. The counterpart will try to maintain a dominant position over the operations of hu- manitarian organizations in the area as, in its view, a sound strategy as both a war tactic and political posturing. Hu- manitarian organizations should expect that sooner or later this conflict between the parties over power dominance will shift despite their agreement and its spirit of collaboration. Nevertheless, the dispute does not prevent the humanitari- an negotiators from seeking renegotiation of the agreement or the clarification of the implementation framework.",

We understand that with the latest new arrivals, it may be difficult to monitor their situation. Yet, their welfare should be a priority in these tragic circumstances. We have observed several cases of sex- ual abuse and trafficking that we reported to your attention a few weeks ago. This situation is well below applicable standards and something needs to be done about it urgent- ly. At the demand of some of our donors, we are here to discuss the situation and see how we can be of assistance in finding practical solutions for these children and avoiding further abuses.\u201d",

We are deeply concerned by the situation and discussions are taking place at HQ and with the Foreign Office to address these ongoing violations of basic human rights of children in your country.

Also, the agent transmitting the position may not carry much authority, due to, for example, having only a weak or dubious connection with the decision makers. Finally, the timing, location, or format of the communication may appear to be confusing or odd, raising ques- tions about the authoritativeness of the communication, i.e., to what extent this communication represents the position of the counterpart or not. The context analysis step further informs this process and helps to identify the position of the counterpart.

This will consequently require the con- tribution of people and experts who know about the rationale and values of the counterpart to explain the reasoning behind the position and elucidate the motives and emotions involved. Ultimately, the conduct of a negotiation, as with navigating around icebergs, must foresee the dynamic of the counterpart and integrate some level of un- certainty in terms of its interests and motives hidden from view. Ignoring this analysis can come at great cost to the negotiation and parties to the negotiation. To illustrate such analysis, one may consider an example drawn",

A POSITIONS AT THE NEGOTIATION TABLE e Explicit: Tribal leaders insist on keeping the hospital fully operational. e Explicit: The guards want to maintain their employment. e Explicit: Families of wounded and de- ceased guards want to be properly com- pensated. e Implicit: Detained staff will be released only when guarantees on the above are provided. e Implicit: In the meantime, emergency needs should be addressed by HfA. HOW did the tribal leaders get to those positions? HOW are the tribal lead- ers planning to proceed? TACTICAL REASONING \u00a2 The detention of HfA staff has been trig- gered by the unexpected announcement of the closing of the hospital by HfA. \u00a2 Guards and tribal leaders were not consult- ed in this process. This lack of consultation questions the authority of the tribal leaders and the professional role of the guards. \u00a2 Both want their voice to be heard loud and clear by those who make such decisions. Detaining staff is the best way to get heard.",

For example, the counterpart could actu- ally be planning an attack against the convoy, in which case the attack is most likely to take place in the no man\u2019s land where it will be difficult to attribute the attack to the counter- part forces. Therefore, the counterpart will try to convince the leader of the humanitarian convoy, through unclear or decep- tive communications, to proceed in order to undertake the attack against the convoy. Several humanitarian professionals have lost their lives in such circumstances because they were not able to distinguish the true interests and motives of the counterparts in the positive response to their request to pro-",

These religious norms cannot be negotiated as if they were technical modalities. Rather, for both sides to this negoti- ation, the issue at stake is whether and the extent to which religious norms should prevail or not over other secular or in- ternational norms and be applied to the enemy POWs. Alter- natively, one should determine if POW detainees should be immune from corporal punishments on humanitarian grounds in view of the exceptional circumstances of their detention and the risk of reprisals against POWs under the power of other parties to the conflict.",

In particular, one may consider building a dialogue ona values-based argument enhancing the protection of POWs within the religious order of the detaining state. A negotiation at the values level is most sensitive and involves a high level of risk, as it tends to generate emotional feedback from both sides of the negotiation table. Negotiation teams are advised to undertake a careful examination of the position, reasoning, and motives of the counterparts as part of the planning pro- cess of a negotiation. While this analysis may confront some of the accepted reasoning and values sets of the humanitar- ian organization, it will be a significant help in the design of the tactics and discussion with the counterpart. This analysis is best conducted in a critical format, i.e., with team members challenging each other to test their understanding of the po- sition of the counterpart.",

But to formulate one\u2019s own humani- tarian organization's position, there is the advantage of hav- ing a known set of values and norms that informs the organ- ization\u2019s operational reasoning in the form of methods, pro- fessional standards, and pro- grammatic objectives. These, in turn, will indicate the starting position of the humanitarian organization in the specific negotiation. This position is then communicated to the counterpart from the outset of the negotiation. Hence, the values and identity of the hu- manitarian organization serve as a bedrock for defining its reasoning and mode of opera- tion, which will then establish a starting position on the techni- cal modalities of the operation to be negotiated. It is impor- tant to build the organization\u2019s",

This dispute arises from HfA\u2019s plans to close the hospital due to decreas- ing war surgery needs in the region. The guards, who belong to an important tribe in the region, claim that the hospital should remain open and their compensa- tion be paid as there are still considerable emergency health needs in the region. The guards, supported by tribal representatives, further argue that they put their life at risk for several years to maintain the access of patients and staff to the hospital during an especially violent conflict. Some guards even lost their life in this",

    "page_content": ". . . . This tool provides a first opportunity to observe the new role and ethos required to enter into a negotiation process. From the role of humani- tarian advocate projecting humanitarian values, norms, and methods, the humanitarian negotiator must become a legitimate interlocutor to listen to the position of the counterpart, understand its tactical reasoning, and show empathy towards its values. The humanitarian negotiator needs to identify the scope of possibilities and explore alternative ways to reconcile two competing nar- ratives. He/she must be further able to \u201cunpack\u201d their own organization's values and methods to make them palatable to the counterpart and see where it is possible to find overlaps in terms of common meanings and purposes. Some of these efforts to build a rapport may exceed the man- date and red lines of the negotiator, yet there will be a time to negotiate within more constrained spaces (see the next module). At this stage, the objective is to establish the basis of a dialogue and spend the required time understanding each other's position.",

Mapping is of particular importance in cases where counterparts play a key political role in their communi- ty (e.g., high-level government officials, tribal leaders, military commanders, etc.) and who may, in such cases, gain or lose consid- erable authority and legitimacy from humanitarian negotiation. Their legitimacy is intrinsically based on their ability to balance the interests of opposing politi- cal forces under their recognized leadership.

While both political mediators and humanitarian negotiators seek to stabilize a conflict situation and minimize risks of fur- ther escalation, the mission of political mediators is to build a political consensus to address the causes of the conflict, while the mission of humanitarian negotiators is to address the immediate humanitarian consequences of the conflict. Yet, pursuing humanitarian access is often misconstrued as a con- fidence-building tactic in the arena of political negotiations. To be recognized as impartial, neutral, and, especially, inde- pendent, humanitarian negotiators must avoid being involved in politically motivated processes. They must be equipped to play at times a political role, exerting pressure on counterparts to seek access to affected populations, while also globally mo- bilizing the necessary attention to ensure the effective deliv- ery of assistance. In this context, one cannot disassociate the mobilization of political support for humanitarian action with the politicization of the same action in specific situations. It depends on humanitarian actors to remain in control of the political implications of their action.",

Although stakeholders may converge or diverge on the particular issue at the negotiation (see the scale of the horizontal axis), they may share some characteristics in the eyes of the counterpart according to how they are grouped in terms of global vs. local constituencies. It is im- portant to note that these characteristics are linked to the perception of the counterpart, in this case the Governor, not the ambition or self-perception of the actors. Hence, as much as an international NGO wants to be connected to the local population, it may well be perceived as a global actor by the Governor, situating it in the top part of the vertical axis. Likewise, as much as a local actor may wish to be perceived as connected to a global movement (e.g., promoting human rights or being part of the Red Cross/ Red Crescent Movement), it may remain a local actor in terms of influence in the eyes of the Governor, since it is composed mostly of local professionals or volunteers and connected to local constituencies. The same applies to all the actors on the map that have any degree of influence on the issue, according to how they are distributed in the four quadrants of the map. One should note that other",

What is perceived as transformative or conservative by one actor may be singularly different from the perspective of another actor. (Special Forces of Country A may well perceive the International Military Alliance as a transformative actor, while the ICRC will see it as a conservative actor. Likewise, Amnesty International may see the Medical Association as a local actor, while Mothers of the Missing will see it as a more global actor.) Perception very much depends on the individ- ual position on the map. This relative perspective becomes significant once IMN starts relating with these stakeholders to understand the entry points of the relationship from their own perspectives.",

Building on the previous modules, it recognizes the role of humanitarian negotiators as networkers in given social and political contexts. The module provides simple mapping tools to locate and assign roles to stakeholders of the counterparts\u2019 policies that affect populations. It concludes by rec- ognizing that humanitarian negotiators should not expect full compliance with the rules of IHL or count on the success of their negotiation. Humanitarian negotiation is akin to a political process for many counterparts. Counterparts have only a limited space in which to move within the acceptable margins of all the stakeholders. The political cost of moving toward the demands of humanitarian organizations will increase as the counterparts make compromises. Network mapping remains a critical tool to initiate a conversation with members of the negotiation team on networks of influence, with the discussion in- formed by the data and knowledge collected by both the team and, especially, national staff, who usually have a greater knowledge of the political ramifica- tions in a given context.",

Red lines cannot be crossed; the cost of breaching one or more of these normative frameworks would lead to significant consequences regarding the validity and le- gality of the agreement between the parties and may have major implications as to the legitimacy of the negotiator and his/her own organization. A breach may also involve legal liabilities for the negotiator, e.g., regarding issues that fall under counter-ter- rorism legislation.

Before con- sidering these options, the negotiator may consult again with his/her hierarchy or stakeholders in the process.

This position is consistent with the institu- tional policy of the organization prohibiting the use of food rations as a cash substitute for commercial transactions or com- pensation for labor. The concern of FWB across its operations is that food rations used as curren- cy could appear to be a diversion of food aid and then be sold to the IDPs, creating a commer- cial interest in preventing the food from reaching those most in need, and making a profit for the sellers out of the IDPs\u2019 malnutrition.",

The position of the counter- part in a negotiation is as much the product of its relationships with influential stakeholders as of its interests and motives. Taking that into account, one should acknowledge that the actual scenarios of a negotia- tion are often a derivative of the objectives and tactics of other major stakeholders. In our case, the camp authorities may not be entirely free to set their red lines in view of the potential influence of armed militias supplying the local guards. The same applies to FWB, which remains very much under the influence of its donors and other humanitarian agencies. As one has analyzed the mapping of influence of the counterpart, one should also note that red lines of other actors, in particular, \u201cspoilers,\u201d may impact heavily on the openness of the counterpart to compromises.

It is understood that the optimal output may not be at equal distance from the two sides but may rely on the understanding of the shared benefit as an outcome of the negotiation and the risk threshold set by the risk culture of an organ- ization. In such case, the use of the impact analy- sis may contribute to promoting a more pragmat- ic perspective on both sides.",

This process is articulated around the role of the mandator who issues the mandate to the negotiator who monitors its implementation. The mandate is informed by the mission and strategic objec- tives of the organization. It is also delimited by the applicable rules and institutional policies governing the activities and interactions of the organization. However, the mandate is not designed to dictate specific tasks, methods, or outcomes of the negotiation but to set a genu- ine space of dialogue with the counterpart, providing sufficient autonomy to the negotiator in adapting the organization\u2019s mis- sion and goals to the reality of the field.

The specific terms of the mandate are generally considered to be confidential between the mandator and the negotiator, and already include a selection of operational objectives and identify areas of potential compromises, taking into account the potential cost and reputational risks. These terms are stipulated to frame the conversation between the negotiator and the counterpart, not the final terms of the agreement. They should remain privileged information between the mandator and the mandatee (the negotia- tor). The specific terms of the mandate may be very close or at times identical to the priorities and objectives identified by the negotiator and his/her team in a specific negotiation process (see Section 2 Yellow). They may also be quite different, depending on the context, the com- mon shared space with the counterparts, and the red lines of each side.",

The guards, supported by tribal rep- resentatives, further argue that they put their lives at risk for several years to maintain the access of patients and staff to the hospital during an especially violent conflict. Some of the guards even lost their life in this process and others sustained long-term disabilities. Families of the guards wounded or killed during the conflict further request long-term monetary compensation for the loss of income before HfA pulls out of District A.",

    "page_content": "In this particular case, the mandate is triggered by the re- strictions imposed on the movement of HfA staff by the trib- al leaders and the untimely announcement of the closure of the surgical hospital. There seems to be no disagreement on the facts (there are no questions about the facts that staff members are detained and there are growing needs at the hospital). The negotiation will essentially be normative in terms of the obligations of the parties regarding the securi- ty of staff and the diligence of HfA in terms of management of the only tertiary medical service available in District A. (For more details on normative negotiation, see Section 1 Green Drawing a Pathway of a Normative Negotiation.) These specific terms will provide a framework for the elabo- ration of specific objectives of the negotiation (P) discussed in Section 2 Yellow Module B: Identifying Your Own Priori- ties and Objectives at the negotiation table. These terms are considered to be part of a confidential relationship between the mandator and the negotiator and his/her team.",

As a private charitable organization, HfA has the authority to decide on its priorities and objectives. It regularly consults with ocal leaders and communities on the de- velopment of its activities. t is also accountable to the health author- ities of District Ain terms of its role and objectives in the health care system of the district. n terms of security of staff and premis- es, it hires guards from the community to help secure the premises (hospital, clinics, residence of staff) in line with applicable egislation and local customs. The guards are lightly armed due to the high level of armed and criminal violence in the context. A direct link is maintained between HfA guards and the local police force. In view of the tribal character of the soci- ety, the selection of the guards is made in consultation with tribal leaders who will propose and review candidates.",

The role of the humanitarian negotiator on the frontlines is to mediate between the parties to find a pragmatic solution within the red lines.",

As a result, humanitar- ian negotiators are well advised to ensure that the proposed operations fall as much as pos- sible within community norms.

It further claims that globally accepted humanitar- ian principles require that the government of Country A does not interfere in the provision of impartial and neutral assistance. FWB also insists that humanitarian action be exempted from any taxation by local authorities on the import of food rations. It argues that these taxes contravene both the fiscal immunity of the UN agency that contracted with FWB and the diplomatic immunity of the donor that funded the project.",

The organization should refrain from operating in this environment unless it is ready to change its red line or if the government agrees to exempt the organization from the rule. The fact that another organization is ready to comply with the demands at the cost of the legitimacy and legality of the arrangement is not a motive to violate one\u2019s own rules.",

There may be situations where the red lines should be adapted by the mandator so as to ensure the humanitarian character of the mission and the objectives of the organization. These decisions have major consequences on the modus operandi and reputation of the organization as well as setting expectations for future negotiations and operations. They should be made at the ap- propriate level of the hierarchy. In all cases, the negotiator is, in principle, not allowed to make decisions on the determination of the red lines as they affect the core of his/her mandate, which is not under his/her control.",

This dispute follows HfA\u2018s plans to close the hospital due to decreasing war surgery needs in the region. The guards, who belong to an important tribe in the region, claim that the hospital should remain open and their compensation be paid as there are still considerable emergency health needs in the region. The guards, sup- ported by tribal representatives, further argue that they put their lives at risk for several years to maintain the access of patients and staff to the hospital during an especially violent conflict. Some of the guards even lost their life in this process and others sustained long-term disabilities. Families of the guards wounded or killed during the con- flict further request long-term monetary compensation for the loss of income before HfA pulls out of District A.",

The red lines further allow the negotiators to maintain a certain level of neutrality between the counterparts and their organization. The role of the negotiators is to intercede between the two icebergs and look for a compromise. Red lines determine an acceptable scope of pos- sibilities for the organization, not for the negotiator per se. Hence, the mandator should always be responsible for deciding on the red lines and never give this role to the negotiator. If the human- itarian negotiator were seen to have authority to control or bend the red lines, the counterparts could put pressure on the negotiator. It would become difficult, if not intractable to maintain a minimum standard without being responsible for the breakdown of the negotiation.",

The man- dator is responsible for setting up red lines and revising them regularly via an ongoing dialogue with the negoti- ator and the negotiation team. Red lines have a number of sources, from community rules to national laws, pro- fessional standards, and ethical norms. These norms may come into conflict. It is critical that the negotiator engages with his/her team to review and discuss normative ten- sions as they are at the core of the humanitarian negotia- tion process. Ultimately, red lines are an essential part of a negotiation. Their implementation should be as cogent as the operations that will result from the negotiation.",
