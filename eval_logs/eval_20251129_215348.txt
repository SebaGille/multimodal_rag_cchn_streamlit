Answer:
1. **Problem framing**: The challenge at hand involves evaluating the reliability of information regarding the safety of a negotiation venue prior to engaging in discussions.

2. **Manual guidance**: The CCHN Field Manual emphasizes the importance of understanding the environment and the narratives of both humanitarian organizations and their counterparts (see Chunk 8).
